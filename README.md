# Project: Weathrly

Primary goal for this project was to create a weather application that pulled data from Weather Underground:

Our project spec as assigned was to create an webpage that is able to accept user input for idea cards that are stored locally on the user's machine. This project also establishes some basic foundations for understanding interaction with user data in a limited scope. Each card is assigned a quality that is dynamic and can be changed by the user via an upvote/downvote. All cards should also persist on the page through reload. Users should also be able to make changes to each idea card and have the changes show dynamically without a page reload. Other project requirements are listed below.

## Project Requirements
The project is separated into five phases. Each section breaks down general requirements.

#### Phase 1: Current Weather
Create a Current Weather component

User Interface should be able to accept mock data and display the following information:
* name of the current city
* current condition
* current day
* current temperature
* expected high and expected low for the day
* summary of what the weather is going to be like that day (â€œWindy, chance of a few late night showers. Lows overnight in the mid 50s.)

Specific contraints for this phase also include:
  * Cannot use any nested if/else statements
  * Should not use anonymous functions (e.g. event listeners)
  * Use of callback functions is preferred
  * HTML must follow basic accessibility guidelines (semantic tagging, image attributes, roles)
  * No use of global variables
  * Functions cannot be longer than 8 lines (including event listeners)

#### Phase 2: 7 Hour Forecast and Location Not Found by API
Application should have a 7 hour weather forecast component. Each hour should be a card component and should display the following:
* specific hour
* image that reflects the weather
* projected temperature

Application should also handle when a user searches for a location that is not found by the API.

#### Phase 3: 10 Day Forecast
Application should have a 10 day forecast component. Each day should be a card component and should display the following:
* name of the day
* image that reflects the weather
* projected high and low temperature

#### Phase 4: Welcome Page and localStorage
Application should include the following:
* Welcome page
* Search input 

Search input should consist of the following:
  * input field
  * submit button
  * should work with both a zip code and city/state

User's location should persist after page refresh.

#### Phase 5: Auto-Complete
Application should have an auto-complete for the Search input. The auto-complete functionality is to be imported form a separate project ([Complete Me](https://github.com/OphDub/complete-me)). Auto-complete should provide suggestions to the user based on city/state or zip code.

#### Extensions
Optional extensions for this project included:

* If a user clicks on a specific day on the 10 day forecast the application should display an hourly breakdown of the forecasted weather for a 24-hour period.
  * For each hour it should display an image that reflects the weather
  * For each hour it should display the projected temperature and the hour

* Add one or two examples of Micro-Interactions found on Dribbble or Behance in your ReadMe that inspired your design

* The application is fully accessible.
  * The application can be used without a mouse
  * zero axe-core violations

* Use Sass / SCSS to style your projects
